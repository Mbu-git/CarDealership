# CarDealership Java Project

A simple Java project modeling a car dealership using OOP concepts.

- **Car**: Represents a car with make, price, year, color, and parts. Supports deep copies and a `drive()` method.
- **Dealership**: Manages an array of cars. Allows getting, setting, and selling cars.
- **Main**: Demonstrates creating cars, managing the dealership, and verifying deep copy behavior.

This project is ideal for learning Java classes, encapsulation, arrays, and deep copying.
